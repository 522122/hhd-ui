The icons in this folder are under the trademark of their distribution owners,
and will be displayed only when this project is used to connect to a Handheld
Daemon instance bundled by those distributions.

They are provided to ensure users of handhelds are not confused by the Handheld
Daemon logo, since, unless they are developers, they will not know what it is.
